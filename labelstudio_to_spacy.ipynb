Smart Farming Optimizing Engine  seleniumNitrogen is so vital because it is a major component of chlorophyll, the compound by which plants use sunlight energy to produce sugars from water and carbon dioxide (i.e., photosynthesis). It is also a major component of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Without proteins, plants wither and die.   Phosphorus is, therefore, important in cell division and development of new tissue. Phosphorus is also associated with complex energy transformations in the plant. Adding phosphorus to soil low in available phosphorus promotes root growth and winter hardiness, stimulates tillering, and often hastens maturity.  Chitra Kumari Al   Potassium is a critical nutrient that plants absorb from the soil, and from fertilizer. It increases disease resistance, helps stalks to grow upright and sturdy, improves drought tolerance, and helps plants get through the winter   Temperatures The average soil temperatures for bioactivity range from 50 to 75F. These values are favorable for normal life functions of earth biota that ensure proper organic matter decomposition, increased nitrogen mineralization, uptake of soluble substances, and metabolism.  e The pH range 5.5-6.5 is optimal for plant growth as the availability of nutrients is optimal.   Rainfall Besides disease, rainfall can also determine how fast a crop will grow from seed, including when it will be ready for harvesting. A good balance of rain and proper irrigation can lead to faster-growing plants, which can cut down on germination time and the length between seeding and harvest.  Names and uses  Using python and its libraries Pandas, create a document classification model, reading different invoices and stored them in the database. Using machine learning and statistical modelling techniques to develop and evaluate algorithms to improve performance, quality, data management and accuracy.   Pandas for handling the data. It contains n number of function for data handling.   Numpy for creating and handling the array.   Matplotlib for visualizing the data. It also helpful in finding patterns in the dataset.   Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It builds on top of matplotlib and integrates closely with pandas data structures. Seaborn helps you explore and understand your data.   Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python.

Technologies and Frameworks NodeJS, MongoDB, MATLAB, TensorFlow.  Core CS fundamentals Data Structures, Algorithm, Operating System, Computer Networks, DBMS, Machine Learning, CNN.  PROJECTS  Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), cancer stages can be easily identified, enabling prompt and appropriate  treatment. The utilization of CNN not only saves significant time compared to conventional methods employed by doctors but also facilitates early decision-making for physicians, allowing treatment at an earlier stage. The technologies employed include Python as the high-level language, TensorFlow, various machine learning algorithms, deep learning for CNN, MRI scans, and MATLAB. The proposed work presents an automated system that will classify if the subjected patient is suffering from brain tumor. This system can assist the physician to make early decisions so that the treatments are carried out at an earlier stage. The proposed approach uses CNN and VGG-16 architecture and weights to train the model for this binary problem.
