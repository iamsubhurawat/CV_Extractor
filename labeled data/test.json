PROJECTS  Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning Using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), cancer stages can be easily identified, enabling prompt and appropriate  treatment. The utilization of CNN not only saves significant time compared to conventional methods employed by doctors but also facilitates early decision-making for physicians, allowing treatment at an earlier stage. The technologies employed include Python as the high-level language, TensorFlow, various machine learning algorithms, deep learning for CNN, MRI scans, and MATLAB. The proposed work presents an automated system that will classify if the subjected patient is suffering from brain tumor. This system can assist the physician to make early decisions so that the treatments are carried out at an earlier stage. The proposed approach uses CNN and VGG-16 architecture and weights to train the model for this binary problem.
